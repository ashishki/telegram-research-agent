# Current Backlog

**Status:** Active lightweight backlog
**Last updated:** 2026-05-31

The historical memory-unification roadmap is complete and archived at
`docs/archive/roadmaps/tasks-v5-memory-unification.md`.

Detailed next-roadmap context lives in
`docs/next_development_roadmap.md`.

## Current State

Implemented:

- Telegram ingestion and normalized post storage
- deterministic scoring and project relevance
- reaction-based feedback sync for original Telegram posts
- inline Telegram feedback cards for implementation ideas
- compact Implementation Ideas feedback cards capped for Telegram scanning
- integration-style bot polling callback dispatch test around `bot.run_bot`
- weekly Research Brief, Implementation Ideas, and Study Plan
- README and active docs aligned with current delivery/feedback behavior
- evidence memory via `signal_evidence_items`
- Implementation Ideas evidence guard: parsed `[Implement]` / `[Build]` ideas without concrete source post URLs render an insufficient-evidence note instead of actionable recommendations
- decision continuity via `decision_journal`
- operator-authored weekly usefulness logs via `weekly_usefulness_logs`
- project context snapshots
- low-signal / empty digest health alerts
- weekly quality trend from Research Brief receipt health alerts in `score-stats`
- monthly `projects.yaml` review guardrail in `health-check`
- memory inspection CLI
- Telegram Channel Intelligence design, schema migrations, deterministic repeated-claim extraction, canonical source-observation refresh, active-project intelligence links, narrative candidate refresh, inspection CLI, and optional Markdown report surface captured in `docs/telegram_channel_intelligence.md`
- Research Brief receipt SQLite schema, storage helpers, generation-time creation, delivery ref updates, deterministic verification checks, CLI inspection, operator review, and optional operator-only audit notes via `research_brief_receipts`
- Core-compatible Research Brief receipt adapter, weekly audit-note hash wiring,
  `memory inspect-core-receipt` for delivered briefs, and deterministic Core
  evidence lookup checks via `--verify-evidence`
- Core receipt schema compatibility tests and product-local boundary guards
- artifact-level operator feedback via `log-artifact-feedback` and
  `memory inspect-artifact-feedback`
- monthly operator report via `operator-report`
- source down-rank explanations via `memory explain-source-downrank`
- product split gate via `product-split-gate`
- production validation surfaces for reaction sync and inline callbacks via
  `ops-validate`

## Active Maintenance Queue

No local implementation tasks remain in this queue.

Production validation is now inspectable with `ops-validate`. If no live
Telegram reaction or callback event has occurred in the selected window, the
command reports `needs_live_event` rather than storing unverified success.

## Parking Lot

- Public/product UI after `PROD-1` passes.
- Referee pass for high-impact claims after source-trust explanations are
  inspectable.
- Productized Telegram Channel Intelligence repo or workspace after repeated
  operator value is demonstrated.
