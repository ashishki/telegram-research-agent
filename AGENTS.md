# Codex Handoff

Status: active
Last updated: 2026-07-26

## Product Direction

The repository is being retrofitted from a weekly-report-centered Telegram
intelligence system into Personal Telegram Research Memory + Grounded Assistant.
HEAD contains corrective PRM implementation slices through PRM-7 and PRM-9
through PRM-10, including bounded SQLite FTS archive search and an assistant
vertical slice. PRM-8 and PRM-11 through PRM-20 are not implemented.

## Operating Rules

- Work directly in this repository; do not spawn nested Codex CLI processes for
  bootstrap or implementation.
- Do not run live Telegram ingestion, reaction sync, Radar, Frontier, report
  generation, full archive LLM backfill, embeddings, or external web research
  jobs unless a task explicitly authorizes it.
- Do not modify production database contents.
- Do not commit private Telegram data or generated private reports.
- Do not enable external skills without approved trust records.
- Human operator is final completion authority.

## Current Next Task

Corrective PRM deep-review evidence and test-tier repair before continuing at
the next policy-allowed PRM boundary.
